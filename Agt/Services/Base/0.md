2.1.Ti=Services and Deliverables

2.1.sec=Client hereby retains and engages {_Service_Provider} to perform and deliver, and {_Service_Provider} agrees to perform and deliver, the {_Services} and the Deliverables as set forth in the applicable EXHIBIT(S). {_Service_Provider} may, at its sole discretion, subcontract any part of the {_Services} as necessary to perform the {_Services} and deliver the Deliverables.

Any invoices not paid by the Due Date are past due and will be subject to a service charge of {Payment.LateCharge.cl} on the outstanding delinquent balance until such balance is paid in full.  Should it become necessary for {_Service_Provider} to proceed with collection measures against the Client to collect any amounts which are past due, the Client agrees to pay for all reasonable costs of such collection, including court costs and attorney's fees.  If any portion of an invoice is not paid in full by the Due Date, {_Service_Provider} may, at its sole discretion, suspend any or all {_Services} until the outstanding invoices are paid in full. Payments will be applied first to any late fees, next to any direct costs incurred on behalf of {_Service_Provider}, and finally any remainder shall be applied to Compensation and Expenses.
